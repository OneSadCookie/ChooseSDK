This is for all you Mac (and maybe in future, iOS) developers who prefer the
command-line.  It's a script which looks at your available SDKs, architectures,
compilers, etc. and figures out which compilers and compiler flags you should
be using.

At the moment it's rather basic -- specify an architecture and an output format,
and you get a couple of the most critical things.  I plan on expanding it, and
if you have fixes or improvements I'd love to see a pull request.
